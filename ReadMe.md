# eslint-plugin-core-practices

Custom lint rules for Javascript projects to ensure core coding practices apart from all the other standard rules.

Some of the core principles it enforces-

1. Function name starting with verb
2. Class name not starting with verb
3. Boolean names starting with `is`, `can`, `should` etc.

There will be many more added pretty soon.

## When should you use it?

If you are continuously raising these points in different code reviews and thinking of having a lint gate instead of you repeating yourself would be much better- then this is for you!
